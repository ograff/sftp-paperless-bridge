# sftp-paperless-bridge

This is a tool to create an SFTP server that sends documents to the paperless API.

Run with `poetry run sftp-paperless-bridge` after setting the following env vars:

- HOST_KEY
- API_URL
- API_KEY
- SFTP_PASS

This has a docker container you can run as well. Ideally better docs to follow.
